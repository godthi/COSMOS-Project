STEPS TO RE-CREATE THE FIGURE:

1) Get the list of differentially expressed genes of the adaptive mutants
The raw sequencing data of these samples are present in the SRA database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) with accession number SRP112804.
2) Reads where be assembled against the CBS138 (ATCC 2001) reference genome, and each
mutant genome was compared to the parental sequences to identify any de novo mutations
using the CLC Genomics workbench (version 6.0.1).
3) Perform GO enrichment analysis - http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-enrichmentanalysis
(to identify any significantly enriched biological processes and functional categories within the
mutated genes and DE genes in the isolated mutants)
Steps to do the analysis is clearly stated in the website - http://www.geneontology.org/page/goenrichment-analysis. (Selected mutations were verified with Sanger sequencing and analyzed
with Unipro UGENE.)
4) Gene ontology analysis tools from both C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae genome database are
taken. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with accession number GSE102502. The currently
known functional annotations for C. glabrata genes were obtained from the Candida genome
database (CGD) [Skrzypek, Jonathan Binkley, Gail Binkley, Miyasato, Simison, and Sherlock 2017]
5) For the the enriched GO term analysis - The Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure is to be performed
to decrease the false discovery rate.
6) From the analysis the enriched transcription factors (TFs) are identified. The “Rank by TF” tool
in Yeastract [Teixeira et al. 2014] is used for this.
7) Statistical tests are performed and Venn diagram for the differentially expressed genes are
plotted.
